# Pumpkin, Chilli, and Coconut Soup

I've been making this recipe since I was in my early 20s. Back then I was a vegetarian, so this soup is happily vegan. However, you can choose to add chicken stock and fish sauce if you're feeding non-vege people. Both options are great.

This makes a really thick, rich soup. Eat it with toast, or better yet, freshly-made roti.

## Ingredients:

- Oil
- Pumpkin or squash of your choice. Personally I like buttercup squash (not to be confused with butternut squash. Buttercup is the short green one, butternut is the tall orange one). You'll want about half a medium buttercup or equivalent.
- 1 400g can of coconut cream, nice thick stuff
- A cup of stock -- chicken, vege, or water if you don't have any stock
- 1 onion
- 3-4 cloves of garlic
- Salt
- About 3cm of grated fresh ginger or a tablespoon of pre-crushed ginger
- Sriracha sauce to taste, I usually use about 2 tablespoons
- Optional -- a Tbsp of fish sauce


## Make the thing:
- Slice onion, mince garlic and ginger
- Chop pumpkin into 2-3cm cubes (remove skin and seeds). Optionally, you can roast the pumpkin and then just scoop out the flesh for use in the soup.
- Sauté onion, garlic, ginger in oil on a medium heat
- Add the pumpkin and sauté for a few minutes
- Add the coconut cream, and the stock or water, bring it up to a simmer
- Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30-40 minutes. The longer the better, really. You want the pumpkin to be nice and soft.
- Remove the pot from the heat and blend the soup with a stick blender. Get it nice and smooth.
- Add sriracha (and you can add more later if it's not spicy enough) and adjust the seasoning -- you might need extra salt if you didn't use stock.
- If the soup is too thick at this point, add water in 1/2 cup increments until you get the consistency you want

## Garnish and serve

- I like to garnish this with fresh coriander and/or sliced spring onions
- Add some toast on the side, or better yet, fresh roti
