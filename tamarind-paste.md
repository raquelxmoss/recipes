# Tamarind Paste

- Break a 200g block of tamarind pulp into pieces and put in a bowl
- Cover in 2 cups boiling water
- Let sit until you can handle the tamarind by hand
- With you hands, mush the pulp from the stringy stuff
- Strain through a coarse sieve and push through with your hands. You can use up to 1/2 cup of water to help coax it along.
- Bring to a boil over a medium heat, stirring constantly
- Put in a jar, it'll probably last forever in the fridge
