## For the Coq Au Vin

- Cut the bacon into lardons, little rectabgles. Summer for 10 minutes in 1.8L water, then rinse in cold water and dry.

- Saute the bacon slowly in hot butter until it is very lightly browned, set aside.

- Dry the chicken thoroughly. Brown it in the hot fat in the pan. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and then add the bacon back into the pan. Cover and cook slowly for 10 minutes, turning the chicken once.

- Uncover and add the cognac. Averting your face, light the cognac on fire with a match. Shake the casserole back and forth several times until the flames subside.

- Add the wine, and just enough stock to cover the chicken.

- Add the tomato paste, garlic, and herbs. Bring to simmer, cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and cooked.

- Remove the chicken.

- While the chicken is cooking, prepare the mushrooms as above, and the onions.

- Simmer the remaining liquid in the pan for a minute or two and skim off the fat. Then, raise the heat and boil it, reducing the liquid to about 470ml. Taste and season, then remove from the heat and discard the bay leaf.

- Blend the butter and flour together into a smooth paste, with a spatula, then beate it into the hot liquid with a whisk. Bring the liquid to a simmer, stirring, then simmer for a few miutes. The sauce should thicken to coat the back of a spoon.

- Add the chicken, mushrooms, and onions back into the pan and baste with the sauce.
