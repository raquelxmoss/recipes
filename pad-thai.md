- Press the tofu and chop

- Chop the palm sugar from the disc
- Chop the shallot

## Method

- To make pad thai sauce, add **3 Tbsp palm sugar** to a small pot and melt over medium heat. Once sugar is melting, keep stirring until it darkens in colour. Immediately add **3 Tbsp water**, **2Tbsp fish sauce**, and **4 Tbsp tamarind paste**. The sugar will harden immediately, this is okay.

- Bring sauce to a simmer, then turn off heat and let the sugar disolve.

- In a bowl, combine **tofu, garlic, shallots, preserved radish, dried shrimp, and chili flakes**.

- Heat a wok or a large nonstick pan over medium heat and add just enough oil to coat the bottom. Sear **shrimp**, or whatever protein you’re using, until done and remove them from pan.

- In the same wok over medium heat, add a little more oil if needed, then add **everything in the tofu bowl** and sauté for a few minutes until garlic starts to turn golden and shallots are wilted. If the wok looks dry, add a little more oil. (Don’t skimp on oil otherwise the noodles will clump up together.) 

- Turn heat up to high then add **noodles and sauce**. Keep tossing until all the sauce is absorbed.
Once sauce is absorbed, you can turn off the heat and taste the noodles for doneness. If they’re still undercooked, add a little more water and continue cooking, being careful not to add too much water.

- Once noodles are done, push them to one side of the pan. Add add little extra oil to the empty space and add **eggs**. Break yolks, then put noodles on top of eggs and cook for about 30 seconds. Flip and toss to mix eggs into noodles. 

- Toss the cooked protein back in. Then add **bean sprouts, garlic chives and half the peanuts**. Turn off the heat and toss until well mixed.

- Serve immediately with garnishes.
