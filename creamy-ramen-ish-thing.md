# Creamy mushroom ramen-inspired noodle thing

[Base recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/vegan-creamy-mushroom-ramen/)

This recipe is based on BudgetBytes' recipe linked above, but with a few differences because I found the original a bit too bland. It's a really easy recipe that's great for when you have low energy levels and need something delicious. See notes below for meal prep and alteration suggestions. Sorry that I'm a bit wishy-washy on quanities, it's one of those things I throw together by feel.

## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp neutral oil
- (optional) 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- (optional) 1-2 cloves garlic
- A heaped handful of mushrooms, any sturdy variety. I've used button, shitake, and oyster.
- (optional) 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1.5 - 2 cups of stock. Vegetable or chicken stock work well.
- Noodles. Honestly, whatever works. 2 minute noodles from the packet (discard the seasoning), fresh noodles from Asian grocery stores, etc. Some sort of noodley thing to soak up the broth. Rice noodles are doable, but see below for suggestions.
- A few handfuls of leafy greens. Gai lan (leafy parts), spinach, bok choy all work well.
- 2 Tbsp of some sort of chilli sauce. I like to use sambal oelek, which contains some ginger, garlic, vinegar, and lime. Sriracha probably works too. Something along those lines. A sauce with actual chilli flakes in it (rather than a smooth, blended sauce) makes for a prettier end result.
- 1.5 cups coconut milk
- Recommended garnishes: spring onion or coriander, a spoon of Lao Gan Ma chilli oil, a drizzle of sesame oil


## Method

- Slice the mushrooms, chop or tear the leafy greens into manageable pieces, mince the garlic (if using)
- In a medium pot, heat 1 Tbsp of neutral oil and optionally 1 Tbsp sesame oil on a medium-high heat
- Add the mushrooms and fry them until they reduce in size, brown on the outside, and release their moisture. I like to do this until they're a bit crispy. During this process, you can optionally add 1 Tbsp soy sauce, which will just add a bit more depth of flavour to the mushrooms.
- Add the stock and bring to a boil
- Add the noodles and let them cook
- When the noodles are nearly done, add the leafy greens and let them wilt
- Turn the heat down to medium and add 1.5 cups of coconut milk and mix it in
- Add 2 Tbsp of your chilli sauce (or to taste) and let all the flavours mingle for a moment before removing from the heat
- Ladle into a bowl and then garnish. My favourite garnishes are spring onion, lao gan ma, and sesame oil. 


## Adjustments suggestions

- Rice noodles cook slightly differently to egg noodles. If using them in this recipe, I suggest cooking them separately, then adding them at the last minute.
- Fresh noodles need much less cooking time, so adjust accordingly. You may want to wilt the greens before adding the noodles, depending on the noodles.
- A soft-boiled egg is a nice topping as well!

## Meal prep and making things easier

I lived off this recipe a lot when I was in the depths of a very bad depression and had next to no energy. To make things easier, here's some things I did:
- Used pre-grated garlic
- Kept a bag of dried mushrooms in my cupboard and used them as needed. You can skip the browning step and just rehydrate them in the broth.
- Used frozen spinach

If meal prepping, make the broth (including the mushrooms) and chill/freeze. When ready to eat, heat the broth and add the noodles. For the leafy greens--your call. Some sturdy spinach will hold up fine in the broth, something more delicate might be better to add when you're ready to eat.
