# Mushroom polenta

250g mixed mushrooms (such as crimini, shiitake, oyster, and/or maitake), torn into 1" pieces
4 sprigs thyme, plus leaves for serving
3 garlic cloves, smashed
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 Tbsp. unsalted butter
1/2 cup polenta
50g Parmesan, finely grated, plus more for serving
1/2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar
Flaky sea salt

Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 160°. Combine mushrooms, thyme sprigs, and garlic on a large rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with kosher salt and pepper; drizzle with oil. Toss to coat mushrooms, then spread out in an even layer. (Make sure not to crowd the mushrooms on the baking sheet; otherwise, they’ll steam instead of getting crispy.) Transfer to upper rack in oven and let mushrooms roast while you prepare polenta.

Bring 2 cups water to a simmer in a large ovenproof saucepan over medium-high heat. Add butter and a generous pinch of kosher salt and whisk to melt butter. Gradually add polenta, whisking constantly. (Gradually incorporating the polenta into the water is key to preventing clumps.) Return mixture to a boil, immediately cover pot, and transfer to lower rack in oven. Bake polenta, shaking baking sheet with mushrooms occasionally, until polenta is tender, 25–30 minutes.


Remove polenta from oven. Crank up oven temperature as high as it will go (but don’t broil). Continue to cook mushrooms until crisp around the edges, 5–10 minutes longer.


Meanwhile, carefully uncover polenta and whisk vigorously, scraping bottom of pan, until polenta is smooth and thick. Gradually add Parmesan, whisking constantly until melted and incorporated; taste and season with more kosher salt and pepper. Cover and keep warm over low heat while mushrooms finish roasting.


Remove mushrooms from oven; drizzle with vinegar. Toss to coat; let cool slightly.
