# Pressure-Cooker Dal Makhani

Serves 2

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup whole urad beans
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 4 teaspoons ginger
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 tablespoon cream
- 1 tablespoon yogurt
- ¼ cup loosely packed chopped coriander
- 1 tablespoon ghee or olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste

## Method

Instructions: Pick and discard any stones or dirt that might be in the beans. Rinse the beans in a medium bowl and soak covered in water for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.

Add the beans, onion, ginger, garlic, garam masala, salt, turmeric and cayenne pepper along with 2 1/2 cups of water to the bowl of the pressure cooker. Stir once and seal the lid; cook on high pressure for 30 minutes.

While the beans cook, mix the cream and yogurt in a small bowl. Then stir it into the cooked beans followed by the coriander.

Heat the ghee or oil in a small saucepan on medium high. Add the cumin and cinnamon and saute for 30 seconds, then add the tomato paste. Cook for 3½ to 4 minutes, stirring until the fat starts to separate from the mixture. Stir this mixture into the dal in the cooker. The final consistency of the dal should be thick, but you can thin it with a bit of water if needed. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

Serve hot with plain rice or bread (preferably flatbread such as roti) and plain yogurt.
