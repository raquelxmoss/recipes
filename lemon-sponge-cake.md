# Mary Berry's Lemon Victoria Sponge

This recipe is for _one_ cake - for a proper sandwich, double the recipe and bake 2 tins worth

## Ingredients

_Note: Ideally, butter, sugar, eggs, and flour should have equal weights, based on the weight of the eggs in their shells_

_Note: I've tried adding some extral lemon juice to the icing for sharpness_

- 112.5g butter, softened
- 112.5g caster sugar
- 112.5g self-raising flour
- 2 eggs
- 1 level teaspoons baking powder
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon

For the filling
- About 4 tbsp lemon curd
- 250g icing sugar, sifted (plus extra for dusting)
- 80g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 25ml semi skimmed milk
- Finely grated zest of half a lemon

## Method

1. Lightly grease one 20cm loose bottomed sandwich tins and line the base with a circle of non-stick baking parchment. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160F/Gas 4.

2. Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl. Beat the eggs and add the grated lemon zest and mix well. Pour the mix in a little at a time and mix well. Sift in the flour and baking powder and combine together. (Mary’s original recipe suggests using an electric whisk – put all ingredients into a bowl and beat for a couple of minutes).

3. Put the mixture in the tin and bake 25 min or until done.

4. Let the cake cool for a few minutes, then turn out of its tin.

5. Make the buttercream by creaming together the butter and icing sugar. Add the milk and lemon zest and beat until smooth.

6. Spread lemon curd and buttercream on top.
