2 ¾ cups rolled oats
1 cup shelled pistachios (or as much as you can afford, really)
1 cup unsweetened coconut chips
⅓ cup pumpkin seeds
Salt to taste
⅓ cup light brown sugar
⅓ cup maple syrup
⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
¾ cup dried sour cherries

- Heat oven to 150C
- Mix dry ingredients apart from cherries
- Add sugar, maple syrup, and oil to a pot and heat on medium-low until the sugar is dissolved
- Mix wet ingredients with dry, then lay out on two baking sheets (baking paper is a good idea)
- Bake for 30 min or so, stirring a few times and swapping the trays around for even browining.
- Remove from oven and cool. Toss in cherries.
