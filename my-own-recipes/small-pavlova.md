# A small pavlova

This is based on Annabel Langbein's recipe, but I'm going to try a 1/2 sized recipe

## Ingredients
- 3 egg whites, at room temperature
- pinch of salt
- 3/4 cup caster sugar
- 1 tsp cornflour
- 1/2 tsp vinegar

## Equipment

- oven
- electric beater. I am going to attempt this with a hand mixer with a whisk attachment.
- baking tray
- baking paper
- large bowl
- spatula
- mug to crack eggs into

## What to do with the egg yolks
- [Custard](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/homemade-custard) (will go nicely with the rhubarb compote)

## Method

- Heat the oven to 180°C.
- Line a baking tray with baking paper and mark a circle about 12cm diameter.
- Place the egg whites into the bowl. Add the salt and beat until stiff. this means when the whisk is lifted from the mixture, the egg white should form a peak which stays upright and curl over a little bit at the end, and the mixture will be shiny and moist looking.
- Slowly add the sugar with the beater running (tablespoon at a time). Beat for about 10 minutes at high speed until the meringue is thick and glossy – it should be thick enough not to fall from the beater.
- Whisk in the cornflour and vinegar.
- Use a big spoon to drop dollops of meringue into the circled area of baking paper. Form into a circle of meringue, making swirls with the spoon on the top rather than flattening to a neat tidy disc.
- Bake at 180°C for 5 minutes then reduce oven temperature to 130°C and cook a further hour. Turn off oven and leave pavlova to cool in the oven. Many recipes say to cool it overnight, ideally.
