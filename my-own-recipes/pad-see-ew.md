# Pad See Ew

Extremely quick, really good weeknight meal for when you can’t be bothered. You can make the sauce ahead of time so you don’t have to worry about that day-of. Cook each portion individually to avoid soggy noodles.

### Ingredients

- 170g protein of your choice
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce for marinating meat, omit if using shrimp or tofu 
- 3–4 Tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 eggs
- 4–6 stalks gai lan or whatever greens you have on hand
- wide rice noodles…however much
- 4 tsp sugar
- Ground white pepper, to taste

**Sauce**

- 2 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 ½ tsp fish sauce
- ½ Tbsp Golden Mountain sauce
- 2 tsp black soy sauce

### Method

- Stir the meat and soy sauce together well, then add about 2 tsp of oil and stir to coat the meat; let sit.
- Combine all sauce ingredients together and stir to mix well.
- Heat 1 Tbsp of the vegetable oil in a wok or a large non-stick sauté pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add all of the protein and cook just until done. Remove meat from pan and set aside in a small bowl. If there is meat juices left in the wok, wipe it with a paper towel.
- Add 1½ Tbsp vegetable oil and garlic to the wok and sauté over medium high heat until the smallest bits of garlic starts to turn golden
- Add 2 eggs, break the yolk, let it set just about halfway, then scramble.
- Add greens and toss.
- Add half the noodles, 2 Tbsp + 1 tsp of the sauce mix, and 2 tsp of sugar. Turn the heat up to high and toss.
- Crank the heat and leave things alone for a few moments so that the noodles can char. Flip them and repeat.
- Add 1 portion of the cooked protein back into the pan. 
- Plate the noodles, then quickly wipe the pan clean with paper towel and cook the next serving.
