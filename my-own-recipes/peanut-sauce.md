# Peanut Sauce

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup natural peanut butter - I use homemade, but store bought is great, just make sure it doesn't have added sugar or whatever else.
- 1/4 cup coconut milk - From a can, not the stuff designed to put in coffee
- 3cm fresh ginger, grated
- juice from 1/2 a lime
- 1 clove garlic, chopped into quarters or thereabouts
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/4 - 1/2 cup water

## Method

- Combine all ingredients except water in a food processor/blender/whatever. I use the little food processor attachment on my stick blender. Whizz for a bit until everything is combined.
- Start adding water and whizz to combine. Add water until you reach the consistency you want.
