# Creamy mushroom ramen-inspired noodle thing

- noodles
- 2 cups stock
- mushrooms
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- neutral oil
- soy sauce
- sambal oelek

## Method

- Slice the mushrooms, mince the garlic. Fry the garlic in neutral oil on medium-high, then add mushrooms and cook down. Splash them with a bit of soy sauce.
- Once the mushrooms are cooked, add stock and noodles and bring to a boil. Add sambal and a bit more soy sauce.
- Bring down the heat to a simmer and add coconut cream. 
- Cook until noodles are done and broth is brothy.
- Top with spring onions or whatever else is around. Ramen egg if you have one.
