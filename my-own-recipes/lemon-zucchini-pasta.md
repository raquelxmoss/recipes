# Creamy Lemon Zucchini Pasta

[Original Recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-lemon-zucchini-pasta)

## Ingredients

- 2-3 zucchini
- 1 large shallot or ½ small onion
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- Salt and pepper
- Long pasta, however much. I like bucatini or linguine.
- 1 lemon
- 15g parmesan, plus extra for serving
- ½ cup (lightly packed) basil and|or mint leaves
- ¼ cup cream

## Method

- Grate the zucchini and put in strainer bag (see note)
- Dice the shallot and garlic
- Squeeze the zucchini and discard the liquid
- Heat 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot on medium-high. Add ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds
- Add zucchini, shallot, garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until zucchini is thick and jammy. Takes about 20 minutes.
- Meanwhile, cook the pasta and set aside a cup of the pasta water
- juice 1 lemon into a small bowl. Grate parmesan. Very coarsely tear or chop the herbs.
- Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with zucchini—it’s okay if some water clings to it. Reduce heat to medium-low, add ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid and cream, and stir to combine. Add cheese, pour another ¼ cup pasta cooking liquid over top, and cook, stirring vigorously with tongs or a wooden spoon and add more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until a creamy sauce that coats pasta forms, 2–3 minutes.
- Remove pasta from heat and stir in lemon juice. Taste and season with more salt and black pepper and add more lemon juice.

## Notes

- I have a bunch of mesh draining bags that I got off AliExpress for making yogurt. These are a million times better than a tea towel for draining the zuchinni and if I didn't own these bags I honestly would not make this recipe.
