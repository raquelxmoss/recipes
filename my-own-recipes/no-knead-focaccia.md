# No Knead Focaccia

Half-recipe, adapted from [BA](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-no-knead-focaccia)

1 scant teaspoon instant yeast
2.5 cups all-purpose flour
However much salt, I never know
3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for hands
2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, plus more for pan

Whisk flour, salt, and yeast together
Add 1.5 cups lukewarm water and mix well
Add 2 Tbsp olive oil and coat the dough
Cover and let rise (8 hours in the fridge, 4 hours at room temp)

Pre-heat oven to 230C
Butter a baking sheet or pan or whatever
Pour 1/2 Tbsp oil into pan
In the dough bowl, fold in all the 'corners' then pop it in the pan
Let it rise uncovered at room temperature, between 90 min and 4 hours

Stretch out the dough, dimple it, then drizzle with 1/2 Tbsp oil. Sprinkle with salt.

Bake at 230C for 20-30 min
