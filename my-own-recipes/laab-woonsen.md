# Laab Woonsen

[Original Recipe](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/laab-woonsen/)

## Ingredients

- 40 g dry vermicelli noodles
- 3 Tbsp uncooked jasmine or sticky rice
- 200g ground pork or chicken, preferably not lean
- 1 head shallots, thinly sliced
- 1 ½ Tbsp fish sauce
- 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice
- Roasted chili flakes, to taste
- ½ cup chopped cilantro
- 1 green onion, chopped
- ½ cup mint leaves, roughly chop large leaves

## Method

- Soak glass noodles in room temp water for 10 minutes.
- Meanwhile, make toasted rice powder: In a dry pan, toast uncooked rice over high heat, stirring constantly, until it has a deep golden brown colour. Remove from pan, then pound in a mortar and pestle or grind in a coffee grinder into a powder. Be sure not to grind it so fine that it's like flour, you want a bit of grittiness.
- Once noodles are done soaking, drain and use scissors to cut into shorter, easier to eat pieces.
- Bring 2-inches of water to a boil in a small pot, add noodles cook 2-3 minutes until done. Drain noodles, but use the pot to catch about 1 Tbsp of the cooking water.
- Place the drained noodles in a mixing bowl.
- Put the pot with that little bit of water back on medium high heat, then add ground chicken and cook, stirring constantly, until done. Add cooked chicken to noodles along with all the juices.
- While noodles are still hot, toss in shallots so the heat can help wilt the shallots slightly. Then add fish sauce, lime juice, chili flakes and toss well.
- Add toasted rice powder and all fresh herbs, toss well, then taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
