# Homemade Yogurt (oven method)

- 2l milk
- 3-4 Tbsp yogurt

## Method

- Add milk to pot and slowly bring to a bare simmer, until bubbles form around the edges, 82 - 93 C. If you do this slowly, it'll be less sour, apparently. Stir the milk occasionally as it heats. It should take 45-50 min.

- Remove pot from heat and let cool to 43 to 48 degrees.

- Transfer 1/2 cup of warm milk to a small bowl and whisk in yogurt until smooth. Stir yogurt-milk mixture back into remaining pot of warm milk.

- Cover pot with a lid. Put it in the oven with the light turned on (not on the top rung).

- Let yogurt sit for 6 to 12 hours, then put it into a stocking or cheesecloth set over a sieve and bowl, so it can strain. Let it strain in the fridge for a few hours until it reaches the desired thickness. Maybe give it a whip at the end for nice consistency.
