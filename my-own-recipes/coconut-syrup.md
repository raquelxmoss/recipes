# Coconut Syrup

To put in coffee as a treat!

## Ingredients

- ¼ cup shredded dried coconut, unsweetened
- ¾ cup drinking water
- 1/3 cup – 1/2 cup palm sugar (chopped and tightly packed)
- ~ 1 cup good coconut milk

## Method

- In a dry saute pan, add the coconut and toast over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the coconut is a dark brown colour.
- Once you achieve the right colour, add the water (it will splatter aggressively).
- Simmer the coconut in the water over low heat for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and strain out the coconut into a heatproof liquid measuring cup. Press out as much liquid as you can from the coconut, you want to extract ALL that flavour!
- Look to see how much water you have left, and add equal parts sugar. Stir to dissolve. If using palm sugar you may need to heat it up in the microwave briefly to help the big chunks dissolve.

## Assembly

- 1 cup hot or cold coffee and optionally, ice
- ~1 ½ – 2 Tbsp toasted coconut syrup
- 3 Tbsp coconut milk
