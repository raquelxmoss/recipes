# Brownies!

This is meant to be a recipe for fudgey brownies, the superior brownie variant, obviously. Adapted from the beloved [BA](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fudgy-brownies) (xoxo thanks Claire), but with the batch halved and the measurements converted to metric.

## Variantions I've tried

- The second time I made these, I used a 50-50 mixture of high-quality dark chocolate (80%) and some lovely belgian milk chocolate (63%). I also added slightly less sugar.
- For coffee-chocolate (mocha, I guess) brownies, add 2.5 Tbsp of dry instant coffee to the dry ingredients. You could add more or less to taste, I will probably experiment with this.
- Stay tuned for a chilli variant
- Raspberries are amazing in this. I just dot frozen raspberries into the mixture after I've poured it into a tin.

## Ingredients

- [ ] Nonstick vegetable oil spray (or, a drizzle of oil to brush onto the foil)
- [ ] ½ cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- [ ] 170 grams semisweet chocolate, chopped
- [ ] 170 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- [ ] 2.5 large eggs (I did 2 eggs plus one yolk)
- [ ] ½ cup granulated sugar
- [ ] ½ cup (packed) brown sugar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Equipment

- [ ] Baking pan, 20cm. Alternatively, a cast iron pan of the same size works great.
- [ ] Foil
- [ ] A bowl to combine the dry ingredients
- [ ] Large bowl over a double boiler for the chocolate and butter. This is where everything will end up.
- [ ] A bowl for the eggs and sugars
- [ ] Whisk
- [ ] Spatula

## Method

Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a 20cm baking pan with foil. Lightly coat with nonstick spray (or brush with oil); set aside.

Sift flour and cocoa in a bowl and whisk to combine well. For coffee brownies, add the instant coffee powder now.

Heat chocolate and butter in an improvised double boiler, stirring constantly, until melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat.

Whisk eggs, both sugars, and vanilla in another medium bowl until smooth, then whisk into chocolate mixture. Add dry ingredients and whisk just until flour disappears and mixture is smooth and glossy. Scrape into prepared pan and smooth top.

Place pan in the oven and reduce oven temperature to 175°C.

Bake brownies until done: when they reach an internal temperature of about 85°C. It will seem underdone, but this way they're seriously gooey. Usually bakes for ~30 minutes.

Remove from oven and let cool for a while inside the tin.

Invert pan onto a wire rack, remove foil, then invert onto a cutting board right side up. Cut into portions.
