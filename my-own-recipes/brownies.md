# Brownies!

This is meant to be a recipe for fudgey brownies, the superior brownie variant, obviously. Adapted from the beloved [BA](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/fudgy-brownies) (xoxo thanks Claire), but with the batch halved and the measurements converted to metric.

## Variantions I've tried

- The second time I made these, I used a 50-50 mixture of high-quality dark chocolate (80%) and some lovely belgian milk chocolate (63%). I also added slightly less sugar.
- For coffee-chocolate (mocha, I guess) brownies, add 2.5 Tbsp of dry instant coffee to the dry ingredients. You could add more or less to taste, I will probably experiment with this.

## Ingredients

- [ ] Nonstick vegetable oil spray (or, a drizzle of oil to brush onto the foil)
- [ ] ½ cup all-purpose flour
- [ ] ¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- [ ] 170 grams semisweet chocolate, chopped
- [ ] 170 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- [ ] 2.5 large eggs (I did 2 eggs plus one yolk)
- [ ] ½ cup granulated sugar
- [ ] ½ cup (packed) dark brown sugar
- [ ] 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

## Equipment

- [ ] Baking pan, 20cm. Alternatively, a cast iron pan of the same size works great.
- [ ] Foil
- [ ] A bowl for the dry ingredients
- [ ] Large bowl over a double boiler for the chocolate and butter. This is where everything will end up.
- [ ] A bowl for the eggs and sugars
- [ ] Whisk
- [ ] Spatula

## Method

Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a 20cm baking pan, preferably metal, with foil, pressing firmly into corners and smoothing creases. Lightly coat with nonstick spray (or brush with oil); set aside.

Sift flour and cocoa in a bowl and whisk to combine well. For coffee brownies, add the instant coffee powder now.

Heat chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water), stirring constantly, until melted and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat.

Whisk eggs, both sugars, and vanilla in another medium bowl until smooth, then whisk into chocolate mixture. For a shiny, crackly top, whisk mixture an additional 10 seconds. Add dry ingredients and whisk just until flour disappears and mixture is smooth and glossy. Scrape into prepared pan and smooth top.

Place pan in the oven and reduce oven temperature to 175°C.

Bake brownies until done:
- they reach an internal temperature of about 85°C OR
- a tester inserted into the center comes out greasy but mostly clean with only a few crumbs attached

I find the internal temperature method better for getting really fudgey brownies, otherwise I tend to leave them in the oven too long.

Usually bakes for 25–30 minutes. Let cool.

Invert pan onto a wire rack, remove foil, then invert onto a cutting board right side up. Cut into portions.
